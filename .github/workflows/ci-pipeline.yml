    steps:
    # Step 1: Checkout the code (this will work when code is pushed)
    - name: Checkout code
      uses: actions/checkout@v2

    # Step 2: Set up Node.js (since you'll use Node.js for the backend and React for the frontend)
    - name: Set up Node.js
      uses: actions/setup-node@v2
      with:
        node-version: '16'  # Specify Node.js version to use (adjust if needed)

    # Step 3: Install backend dependencies (in the server directory)

      run: |
        cd server
        npm install

    # Step 4: Install frontend dependencies (in the client directory)
    - name: Install frontend dependencies
      run: |
        cd client
        npm install

    # Step 5: Run backend tests (you can later add tests here)
    - name: Run backend tests
      run: |
        cd server
        echo "Backend tests will be added later."

    # Step 6: Run frontend tests (you can later add tests here)
    - name: Run frontend tests
      run: |
        cd client
        echo "Frontend tests will be added later."

    # Step 7: Build the backend (if applicable, you can add build scripts later)
    - name: Build backend
      run: |
        cd server
        echo "Backend build step will be added later."

    # Step 8: Build the frontend (React app)

      run: |
        cd client
        npm run build

    # Step 9: Deploy to production (optional)
    - name: Deploy to production (optional)
      run: |
        echo "Deploying project..."  # Placeholder for deployment steps, add your actual deployment commands (e.g., Heroku, AWS, Netlify)
